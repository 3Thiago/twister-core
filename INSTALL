Building twister

***************************************************************
*** THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE - THE BUILD SYSTEM IS UNFINISHED ***
***************************************************************

This software is a proof-of-concept, a forced marriage between
bitcoin and libtorrent codebases. So don't expect an easy ride.
Building this thing is quite hacky (but hopefully not complicated).

In order to build twister you need to configure both bitcoin's and
libtorrent's.

1) Start with libtorrent:

$ cd libtorrent
$ ./bootstrap.sh
$ ./configure --enable-logging --enable-debug --enable-dht

Note1: 64-bit systems may need "--with-boost-libdir=/usr/lib64"
Note2: disable logging if you want, but at this point it might
       help to diagnose problems in case anything goes wrong.

2) Then, for bitcoin/twister, you have actually two choices to
build. Both will produce (almost) the same "twisterd" executable,
so try which one works for you.

2a) Using qmake

$ qmake
$ make

2b) Using standard makefile

$ cd src
$ make -f makefile.unix


DEPENDENCIES
============

OpenSSL, Berkeley DB, Boost and miniupnpc are required.
